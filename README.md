## Developing
### Prerequisites
#### `Python: >= 3.6`

See https://www.python.org/downloads/ to install


#### `NodeJS: >= 14.15`

See https://nodejs.org/en/ to install


#### `Recommend IDE: Pycharm`

See https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac to install


### Virtual Environment Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/verifiablesoftware/vsw.git
pip3 install virtualenv
cd project root directory
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Components
There are also 3 daemon processes are running at the same time when vsw is running.
You can check them with command below.

```ps -ef|grep vsw```
#### aca-py 
This is used to communicate with aca-py in repo
#### vsw-controller
This is used to receive the notification of webhook from aca-py, also save credential in the local.
#### localtunnel
This is used to exposes your localhost to the world for easy testing and sharing! No need to mess with DNS or deploy just to have others test out your changes.
see https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel to get the detail.
The localtunnel is installed in the following folder when 'pip3 install vsw'

```~/vsw_tools/localtunnel-master```

The script file how to install localtunnel is placed in the file below.  

```<project root dir>/vsw/conf/local_tunnel.sh```

### Storage
The wallet information and credential information are saved in the local sqlite database.
The sqlite database file is saved in the following path.

```~/.indy_client```


### Configuration
The vsw configuration file is in the following path. it includes tails server and repo server address, also includes aca-py related configuration and schema info.
 
```<project root dir>vsw/conf/vsw.ini```


### Logger
The logger file is placed in the the following folder.

```~/vsw_logs```

There are four logger files in this folder.  
aries-cloud-agent.log (for aca-py)     
lt.log (for localtunnel)  
vsw-controller.log (for vsw controller)     
vsw.log (for vsw)



## How to package vsw?
