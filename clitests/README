The scripts are for testing vsw using the client tool in Ubuntu Bionic.
If you wish to run it in a Docker container, "start" shows how to start the container.

"test1-install" installs everything you need for a Ubuntu Bionic container, which is also test1.
"alltests" runs all the actual test cases using fresh set of 3 new wallets.
"repeattests" run a few simple sanity tests for an existing wallet.

To preserve wallets (and other useful info) across containers, you can tar and save these 3 directories in $HOME:

% tar cvf vswsave.tar .indy_client vsw_logs vsw_tools
% cp vswsave to-persistent-store

and recover by:

% cp from-persistent-store/vswsave $HOME
% cd $HOME
% untar xvf vswsave.tar

Now, run "repeattests" to sanity check.
