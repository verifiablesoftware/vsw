command: vsw register


Synopsis: create a new DID

Description:

this test case will create keys (signing and encryption keys) for a new DID (owned by the
caller of the library). Identityâ€™s DID must be either explicitly provided, or taken as the
first 16 bit of verkey. Saves the Identity DID with keys in a secured Wallet (.MyWallet), so that it 
can be used to sign and encrypt transactions.

Execution Steps:
	1- mkdir ~/myproject
	2- cd ~/myproject
	3- vsw register

Expected output:
export $MYWALLET=$HOME/.MyWallet

Example of relative and absolute DID URL:

{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }, ...],
  "authentication": [
	// a relative DID URL used to reference a verification Method above

    "#key-1"
  ]
}

In the example above, the relative DID URL value will be transformed to an absolute DID URL value of did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1.
