	1- the man1 directory contains all the man pages for VSW

	2- the files are i.1.gz fomat and can be edited using your favorate editor t.e. vi, vim, etc

	3- after you clone this diroctory into your local enironment, you need to move all the .gz files to /usr/local/man/man1 in your local environment

	4- once you have copied the .gz file to  your local environment you can then run the following command to display the manpages:
		man vsw [command] whre command is:
			-> audit
			-> list
			-> verify
			-> attest
			-> register
			-> ...etc
